## What moment impacted you the most in the film and why?

The moment that impacted me the most in the film was when the first go player realized that the AI was really good and could defeat him, even when he thought before that it was "just a program". Also when the world champion was playing the AI and was saying that he was doubting himself because he was playing an AI instead a human.

## How did AlphaGoâ€™s approach to decision-making differ from that of its human opponents?

AlphaGo's approach to decision making differed from that of its human opponents by using calculations instead of intuition. As said in the documentary, many Go players say that they played a move because they felt like it, resulting in some moves lost. AlphaGo, on the other hand, uses calculations that can predict many times into the future, and can play the best probability move to win the game. 

## What surprised you about how AlphaGo learned or played the game?

I was surprised about how it learned how to play go. It got actual humans, but also got info from playing itself, creating an extremely powerful AI that can play Go very well. I was also surprised when the AI played the move that no human would make, it understood that no human would make it, but played it anyway from its own knowledge from playing itself. 

## Do you believe AlphaGo demonstrated creativity? Defend your answer

I don't think AlphaGo demonstrated creativity because it is, as always, an AI. What we were mistaking as creativity was just a probability that went one way instead of another, causing the AI to make one move instead of another. AI is stochastic, so the result is not always the same, creating new moves that people mistake for creativity, when it is just probabilities. The people mistake it for creativity because they haven't seen it, but the AI has in the games with itself.
